# How to create Neumorphic UI chart in .NET MAUI SfCartesianChart
This article explains how to create a visually stunning Neumorphic UI chart using [Syncfusion .NET MAUI Column Chart](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/column) ([SfCartesianChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/getting-started)).

## Overview

Neumorphism is a modern UI design trend that blends elements of skeuomorphism and flat design to create soft, tactile interfaces. It simulates a 3D effect using carefully balanced highlights and shadows, giving UI components a sense of depth and realism while maintaining a clean and minimalist aesthetic. The design approach is often characterized by subtle embossing or debossing effects, making elements appear as if they are extruded from the background.

## Why Use Neumorphism in UI Design?

**Visually Appealing:** The soft, floating effect creates an elegant and modern look.

**Minimalist Yet Engaging:** It enhances flat designs with a slight 3D touch, making the UI more interactive.

**Consistent Design Language:** Neumorphism offers a unique identity that can make an app feel polished and cohesive.

This sample showcases implementing a Neumorphic design in a .NET MAUI application to enhance the visual appeal of an SfCartesianChart.
