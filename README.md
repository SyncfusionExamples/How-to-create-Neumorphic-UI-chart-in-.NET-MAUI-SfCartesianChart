This article explains how to create a visually stunning Neumorphic UI chart using Syncfusion .NET MAUI Column Chart (SfCartesianChart).

## Overview
Neumorphism is a design trend that simulates a 3D effect using light and shadow to give UI components a sense of depth and realism, while still maintaining a minimalist and clean aesthetic.

While visually appealing, Neumorphic UI should be implemented thoughtfully to avoid issues like low contrast, which can affect accessibility.

This sample showcases implementing a Neumorphic design in a .NET MAUI application to enhance the visual appeal of an SfCartesianChart.
